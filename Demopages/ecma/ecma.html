            <p>In 1997, due to JavaScriptâ€™s rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed. Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing. The ECMA specifications were labeled ECMA-262 and ECMAScript languages included JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

              Between 1997 and 1999, ECMA-262 had three revisions, but nearly 10 years later, version 4 was abandoned due to differing opinions on the direction of the language and its proposed features. Interestingly, many of these controversial features, such as generators, iterators, and destructuring assignments, have been included in more recent ECMAScript specifications.</p>
        <h2>What is EcmaScript?</h2>
              <p>The European Computer Manufacturers Association Script (ECMAScript) is a JavaScript-based scripting language. Microsoft created their own scripting languages, such as VBScript and JScript, in 1996. EcmaScript was a standard created by Ecma International in November 1996 after Netscape submitted JavaScript for standardization. EcmaaScript was also included in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard, which was issued in June 1997. Although JavaScript and EcmaScript are closely related, they do not signify the same thing.</p>
